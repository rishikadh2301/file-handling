# Sorting & Searching Algorithm Benchmark 

This Python script implements and compares different sorting and searching techniques, including **insertion sort, merge sort, linear search, and binary search**. It also benchmarks their performance.

## Features âš¡
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Insertion Sort (Bubble-sort-like approach)
  - Merge Sort (Efficient divide-and-conquer)
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- **Performance Comparison**
  - Measures time taken by **linear search** vs. **binary search** on large datasets.

## Installation ðŸ“¥
1. Ensure you have **Python 3+** installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rishikadh2301/file-handling.git
   cd your-repo-name

## EXAMPLE of output

Sorted Small Data: [5, 7, 8, 12, 23, 29, 32, 34, 40, 62]
Linear search target position: 7   time taken: 140.2 microseconds
Binary search target position: 7   time taken: 5.6 microseconds
