# Sorting & Searching Algorithm Benchmark 

This Python script implements and compares different sorting and searching techniques, including **insertion sort, merge sort, linear search, and binary search**. It also benchmarks their performance.

## Features âš¡
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Insertion Sort (Bubble-sort-like approach)
  - Merge Sort (Efficient divide-and-conquer)
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- **Performance Comparison**
  - Measures time taken by **linear search** vs. **binary search** on large datasets.
